# AI From Scratch

A project dedicated to building artificial intelligence algorithms and models entirely from scratch. This repository aims to explore and implement fundamental AI concepts without relying heavily on pre-built libraries or frameworks.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to understand the inner workings of AI by implementing algorithms manually. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Neural Networks
* Machine Learning algorithms (supervised and unsupervised)
* Reinforcement Learning
* Optimization techniques
* Data preprocessing and evaluation metrics

By building these systems from scratch, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of how AI works at its core.

## Features

* Implementation of core AI algorithms using Python (or preferred language)
* Step-by-step explanations of each algorithm
* Simple, modular code to encourage experimentation and learning
* Focus on clarity and understanding over performance

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Install dependencies (if any):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Explore algorithms in the `/src` or `/notebooks` directory.
