# AI From Scratch

A project dedicated to building artificial intelligence algorithms and models entirely from scratch. This repository aims to explore and implement fundamental AI concepts without relying heavily on pre-built libraries or frameworks.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to understand the inner workings of AI by implementing algorithms manually. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Neural Networks
* Machine Learning algorithms (supervised and unsupervised)
* Reinforcement Learning
* Optimization techniques
* Data preprocessing and evaluation metrics

By building these systems from scratch, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of how AI works at its core.

## Features

* Implementation of core AI algorithms using Python (or preferred language)
* Step-by-step explanations of each algorithm
* Simple, modular code to encourage experimentation and learning
* Focus on clarity and understanding over performance


## Roadmap

* [ ] Linear regression from scratch
* [ ] Logistic regression
* [ ] Feedforward neural networks
* [ ] Backpropagation
* [ ] Convolutional neural networks
* [ ] Reinforcement learning basics
* [ ] Optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, etc.)
* [X] Attention Mechanism
* [X] GPT
* [X] Ensemble (Bagging)
